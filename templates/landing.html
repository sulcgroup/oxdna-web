                Welcome to oxDNA.org, a service of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.public.asu.edu/~psulc/">Å ulc</a> lab at Arizona State University.  Our goal is to facilitate development of more advanced and complex
                designs in the fields of DNA and RNA nanotechnology by facilitating non-experts to run simple simulations. This server uses oxDNA and oxRNA models to simulate DNA 
                and RNA nanostructures to verify and prototype novel designs.
                The simulations this server supports are equilibrium sampling of assembled designs, meant to 
                assist users to test in silico their designs before taking them to the lab. The server is provided for free for anyone. We ask you to be considerate to other users and keep the server usage reasonable. We also ask you to review FAQ below prior to submitting your first job.

            <div class="panel">
                <p>OxDNA and oxRNA are coarse-grained models specifically developed to simulate nucleic acid nanotechnology. They are parametrized to reproduce basic structural, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties of DNA and RNA.
                 OxDNA is also the name of a  <a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/oxdna">software tool</a> implements, among others, the oxDNA and oxRNA models. To learn more about the models, please look at Citations or explore the webpage <a target="_blank" href="https://dna.physics.ox.ac.uk">dna.physics.ox.ac.uk</a></p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>To start an oxDNA simulation, you need three files: topology (.top) and configuration (.conf or .dat) that describe the structure, and input file that describes 
                 the parameters of the simulation (such as temperature, duration of simulation, salt concentration). The format of these files is described in detail <a target="_blank" href="https://dna.physics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/Documentation">here</a>. The server generates automatically the input file for you,
                 but you need to provide the .top and .dat file for the simulation server that describe the configuration you want to simulate.</p>

                <p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://tacoxdna.sissa.it/">TacoxDNA webserver</a>
                 provides a variety of conversion tools from popular DNA nanotechnology design platforms to the oxDNA format.  Some tools, such as vHelix, Adenita,
                 and MagicDNA have built in oxDNA outputs.  Designs from CaDNAno often need to be relaxed using rigid-body dynamics prior to simulation, 
                 this can be done in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna-viewer">oxView</a> (hit the "try it!" link in the description).</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>These simulations are run on NVIDIA 2080 RTX GPUs, which easily handle origami-sized (10-20k bases) designs.
                Designs with more than 50k bases may not finish in the time allotted to each job. It also makes sense to only use GPU cards for simulations of structures of sizes at least 300 nucleotides,
                when the GPU provides significant speed-up over CPUs For smaller systems, we recommend submitting them to CPU. They will run just as fast and will leave GPUs available for larger simulations.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>For an origami-sized structure running with the default option of 1e9 steps, we are looking typically at about 2 days running time. The running time scales almost
                    linearly with the number of nucleotides, but please note that each structure is different. You can opt into receiving emails when jobs complete on the <a target="_blank" href="https://oxdna.org/account">My Account</a> page.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Currently, it is not possible. The model only support simulations of DNA or RNA molecules alone. We have a model in development that allows you to represent also proteins, but it has not 
                 been deployed to the server yet.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Due to storage limitations, the simulated trajectory gets automatically deleted after 1 week. You will receive a reminder by e-mail, but we strongly recommend 
                to download all data once simulation is finished. The start and final configuration file will remain available on the server, as well as results of analysis that you carried out on the server.</p>

            <div class="panel">

            <button class="accordion" onclick="toggle(this)"><b>What is the real-time correspondence of these simulations?</b></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Coarse-grained simulations such as oxDNA speed up different processes
                by different amounts, so it is impossible to put an exact time correspondence between simulation and real experiment. For more discussion on this topic, see e.g. <a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.5b05865"> this article</a>.
                On the server, these simulations will be run by default for 1e9 steps with a timestep of 0.001 simulation time units, which by direct unit conversion corresponds
                to 3.03 &mu;s.  However, due to accelerated diffusion constant that we use, it can be argued that it can roughly correspond to timescale on the order of up to 1 ms. Increasing dt 
                in the simulation parameters can allow you to simulate longer times with the same amount of steps, but can also lead to numerical instabilities and errors. We do not recommend using 
                dt larger than 0.003.</p>

            <button class="accordion" onclick="toggle(this)"><b>How long should I run my simulation for?</b></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>By default, we set the simulation to run for 1e9 steps. This is usually sufficient to get enough statistics to explore behavior of a typical DNA origami-sized structure.
                However, if your system is more complex and can undergo different conformational transitions, it might not be enough. You should visualize the entire trajectory in oxView and plot energy file versus time and see 
                that each relevant state is sampled, and that energy of system does not diverge, but rather keeps fluctuating around mean value. Similar analysis can be done with distance evaluation, checking that distances between parts of structure of your interest have crossed multiple times between proximal and distant states.</p>
            </div>
            
            <button class="accordion" onclick="toggle(this)"><b> Is what I see in the simulation real?</b></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Remember that oxDNA is just a model, which makes numerous approximations to simulate efficiently the nanostructures. While in majority systems that we studied
                previously, we found quantitative or semiquantitative agreement with available experimental data, you should still take results with a grain of salt and ask yourself:
                is the behavior seen in simulations something that my system should be able to do? Simulations can never replace experiments, but might help you get insight into the function.
                If you are in doubt, do not hesitate to contact us or check out some of our publications where we study systems similar to yours for further discussion of underlying phenomena.</p>

            <button class="accordion" onclick="toggle(this)"><b> I want to add external forces to the simulation. How do they work?</b></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>In the "Advanced Parameters" section on the submission form there's a file upload for external forces.  OxDNA implements a variety of different external force potentials which are defined by specifically-formatted text files. 
                    A full list can be found in <a target="_blank" href="https://dna.physics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/Documentation#External_Forces">the documentation</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most popular types of forces is a mutual trap, used, for example, to bring two single-stranded segments into proximity to facilitate binding.  These can be generated interactivley in oxView by selecting pairs of nucleotides you would like bound, 
                    selecting "Create from selection" in the forces dialog from the Dynamics tab and then downloading the file with the "Forces" button in the oxDNA files section of the File tab.

            <button class="accordion" onclick="toggle(this)"><b> The simulation is finished. How do I analyze the results now?</b></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>We recommend that you download the trajectory file and visualize it using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna-viewer">oxView</a>. 
                Furthermore, we provide multiple automated analysis options, based on the tools that we developed <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa417">here</a>. Currently implemented analysis allows you
                to obtain mean structure and standard deviations from the mean structure to visualize its flexibility. You can also check distances between nucleotides, bond occupancy and angles between different stems in the simulation trajectory. For more
                complex analysis, you can use our python tools to analyze the trajectory that you downloaded (see tutorials and examples <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna_analysis_tools">here</a>).
                The trajectory is compressed in zip format and will need to be inflated prior to use (older trajectories were compressed in 7zip format which, while higher compression, had limited support).</p>

            <button class="accordion" onclick="toggle(this)"><b>My simulation log shows an error!  What do I do?</b></button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Errors are most frequently due to the model encountering unphysical states because of
                insufficient relaxation. This often happens when you convert from a different format (most often caDNAno) where the 3D positions of helices are not physical and some of the distances between neighboring nucleotides are unphysically large.
                Structures exported from design tools are rarely in a physically viable state and must be relaxed prior to production
                simulation.  We have tried to provide a reasonable relaxation protocol automatically, but for some structures it is insufficient.
                  Try resubmitting your job and increasing the length of the relaxation steps or decreasing the dt of the MD relaxation.</p>

                <p>On "View Jobs" page, you can see the cluster status and how many nodes are currently occupied and the total number of jobs scheduled in the queue. The jobs are scheduled on first come first serve basis, and you might need to wait until other jobs finish before yours gets scheduled.
                    We currently impose a limit of 4 submitted jobs per user and a maximum running time of 4 days per job. 
                   These constraints might change in the future and we reserve the right to limit the allowed maximum running time and number of submitted jobs for users that use the server heavily. While we have plans to expand the capacity of the server in the future, it is currently equipped only with 8 GPUs. Hence, we ask users to be considerate
                    and not use it excessively. For complex simulation tasks (such as FFS) and large number of designs to try, we recommend that you either purchase your own GPU server or use your own university HPC resources. Most universities have GPU servers available for their researchers.
                    The evaluation scripts that are used on our server are available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sulcgroup/oxdna_analysis_tools">here</a>  and you can use them to evaluate and visualize your results from your local HPC service provider.</p>
